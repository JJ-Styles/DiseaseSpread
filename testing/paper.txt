Behaviour Space
"BehaviorSpace runs a model many times, systematically varying the modelâ€™s settings and recording the results of each model run." This paper uses a built this tool within Netlogo to create different run scenario options. Behaviour space allows the user to automatically run a series of different values, that are inputs on the model, and gather the results. Behaviour Space works by taking a single value, or a range of values for each input and then the user gives the test harness what they want to be recorded. It runs the each value individually and outputs a value for what they want to be recorded every tick ran. The user can also specify extra conditions like a end statement, repetitions or a final clause. The tool also allows the user to run multiple tests at a time if they have a computer with multiple processor cores by run each run on a separate core. Behaviour Space is very useful in large models where there are lots of permutations of inputs, this is because Behaviour space will change all the values for the user, and record the results, automatically and therefore reduce the time it would take for a user to carry out the runs and reduces the chance of missed permutations.
